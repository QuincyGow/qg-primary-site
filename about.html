    <h1 class="heading-one">Professional</h1>
    <p class="text">In the mid 2000s I attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs Ohio, graduating in 2007.  The primary focus of my studies was documentary filmmaking.  I spent 3 semesters studying off campus for the school's co-op program which took me to Aspen, New York City, and Bolivia.  After graduating in 2007, I pursued a film career in NYC primarily in Production and Locations.  My final project was a documentary film I directed entitled "Ed's Whale" about a friend who pushed to publish a book while fighting a battle with cancer.  During this process I self-published his book and spent 5 years editing and gathering footage for the film.  After that I pursued a career in photography for a few years in and around Los Angeles mostly focusing on portrait work with an emphasis in fashion and editorial.  This is when I began crafting my own web-sites to display my work and where my fascination with building dynamic and responsive web-sites began.  Under the tutelage of Brad Frost, author of "Atomic Design", I continue to expand my knowledge of web design and continue to further my understanding of both front and backend design elements.</p>

<h3 class="heading-one">Personal</h2>
    <p class="text">I was born 1978 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was an only child.  I read a lot of comics and drew in my spare time.  Later on, I made electronic music and started taking pictures with my 35mm Pentax.  I went to school, got an associates degree, then a bachelor's degree.  I traveled as much as I possibly could.  Now I live in Pittsburgh, which is pretty great.</p>
